## 📋 Before You Start

1. **Read the docs** → [careeros-docs](https://github.com/Careers-Os/careeros-docs) — understand the system architecture and roadmap
2. **Find an issue** → Filter by `good-first-issue` if you're new
3. **Comment on the issue** → Say "I'd like to work on this" before starting — avoids duplicate work
4. **Wait for assignment** → A maintainer will assign it to you within 24–48 hours
